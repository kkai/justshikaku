// MARK: - Compile-time guard
//
// These helpers are `nonisolated` and synchronous. If `Theme` or `Motion` ever
// loses `nonisolated` and falls back to the project's MainActor default, every
// reference below becomes
//     "main actor-isolated static property 'x' can not be referenced from a
//      nonisolated context"
// and THE TEST TARGET FAILS TO BUILD. That is deliberate: the build breaks
// before the runtime guard below gets a chance to take the whole test runner
// down with a SIGTRAP.
//
// `nonisolated` on these functions is not optional. ShikakuTests inherits
// SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor from the project, so an unannotated
// helper would itself be MainActor-isolated and this guard would silently pass
// forever.
